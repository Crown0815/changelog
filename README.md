# Changelog Creator

A tool to generate a changelog based on git commit history using
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is very much a work in progress. This is also my first
F# project, so there might be a lot of potential for improving the implementation.
