# GitHub Release Template

The GitHub Release Template renders a change log suited to be used as the description of a [GitHub Release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases).

This template **only supports including the changes of a single version**, so it should be combined with the [Version Range setting](../configuration/settings/version-range.md).
Compared to the default template, the GitHub Release template omits the "Change Log" and version headings and adjusts the heading levels so the changelog can is properly rendered in the Releases view of the GitHub web interface.

**Note:** The GitHub Release template is independent of the [GitHub integration](../integrations/github.md) for links.
Both features can be used independently of each other.

For configuration options, see [GitHubRelease Template Settings](../configuration/settings/githubrelease-template.md).

## Version support

Support for templates and the "GitHub Release" template was introduced in version 0.2.
